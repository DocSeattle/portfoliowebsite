                <h3>Website Icon</h3>
                <p>
                    I took some time today, just as
                    a break from all the faff with 
                    HTML to make a proper icon for 
                    this here website. This is 
                    what I came up with.

                    Considering this is my first 
                    proper project with Vector 
                    images, I'm really quite chuffed
                    with how it came out.

                <p>I've been working a great deal
                    on this website, I think that
                    getting a place to more permanently
                    upload, store and archive things
                    that I make can only do me good

                <h3>Movement Statemachine</h3>
                <p> I've spent a fair bit of time
                    trying to learn how to code
                    in C#, for the sakes of getting
                    into game development. My engine
                    of choice has been Unity3D and
                    my first project in Unity is
                    to make a statemachine that
                    can easily be made to handle
                    most movement in any project.

                <p>
                    Spent time refactoring the site.
                    What that actually means is that 
                    I spent roughly 5 hours trying to
                    make SCSS files want to import 
                    variables, mixins and whatnot
                    so that I can have a cleaner slate
                    when actually working.

                <h3>Website Development #4</h3>
                <p>
                    Development of the site
                    has been an uphill battle the 
                    past few days. First, half of the
                    css file didn't save, which is both
                    very strange and incredibly infuriating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I decided to start 
                    using GIT for source control and web
                    hosting through their Pages service.
                    Which, whilst yes, is a good idea,
                    takes many hours to actually get running
                    in my case. Learning how to navigate github,
                    understanding branches, push, pull, commit
                    and deploy. As well as getting the Pages 
                    environment to build from the correct 
                    branch of the project all was a confusing
                    mess of a process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, it is now done, and I should be able to
                    continuously deploy the site and it'll update
                    after each one. For the moment, though. I 
                    have to be wary of how I format the /dist 
                    file structure. My main issue stems from 
                    the Pages environment not navigating files
                    as I'm used to.
